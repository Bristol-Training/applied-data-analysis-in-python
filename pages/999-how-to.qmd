## How to read this documentation

In this documentation, any time that we are seeing a small snippet of Python code, we'll see it written in a grey box like the following:

```{.python}
print("Hello, Python")
```

If the commands are executed by the machine we will see the output of them below enclosed on a vertical purple line:

```{python}
print("Hello, Python!")
```

By contrast, you will see larger peces of code as scripts with a given name, e.g. `script.py`, in a code block with darker header:

```{.python filename="script.py"}
greeting = "Hello"
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(greeting, name)
```

We may ask you to run a script using the `Command Prompt` (Windows) or `Terminal` (Mac and Linux). We will show you what commands to run and will look like this:
```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python script.py
```

**Please note that sometimes we will skip showing the execution of scripts on the Terminal/Command Prompt box, but we will assume you to run the script on your.**

In some cases we will introduce general programming concepts and structures using pseudocode, a high-level, easy-to-read syntax close to natural language. This should not be confused with Python code and cannot be executed on your machine, but it is useful to describe how your code should behave. Here there is an example:
```
FOR EACH sample IN my_study
    IF (sample.value > 100)
        DO SOMETHING
    OTHERWISE
        DO SOMETHING ELSE
```


Each section will start with a learning outcomes box that highlight the important activities in the section, like this one:

::: {#highlights .callout-note icon=false title='In this section...'}
These are important concepts and technical notes.
:::

There are some exercises along this course, and it is important you try to answer them yourself to understand how Python works. Exercises are shown in blue boxes followed by a yellow box that contains the answer of each exercise. We recommend you to try to answer each exercise yourself before looking at the solution. 

::: {#exampleN .callout-tip icon=false title='Exercise'}
This is an exercise. You will need to click in the below box to see the answer.
:::

::: {#answerN .callout-caution icon=false title='Answer (click to open)' collapse="true"}
This is the answer.
:::

Last, some notes for the trainers are provided in red boxes like the one below. The notes are hidden by default but can be read by all.

::: {#trainer .callout-warning icon=false title='Trainer notes' collapse="true"}
This are some suggestions on how to deliver the section and some key points.
