        "## What is logistic regression?\n",
        "Logistic regression is a tool that can be used for solving *classification problems*, in particular, predicting the probability of a binary outcome. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Predicting whether “it will rain or not” (yes/no)  \n",
        "- Predicting whether “a house is worth buying” (worth/not worth)  \n",
        "\n",
        "## When is logistic regression Suitable?\n",
        "Logistic regression is useful when you need to make a “two-choice” decision (though it can also be extended to more categories).  \n",
        "It’s suitable in scenarios like:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Classification problems**: Like predicting “will a student pass or fail?” or “does a patient have a disease?”  \n",
        "2. **Quantifiable features**: When you have numerical inputs (like house size, income) to base your prediction on.  \n",
        "3. **Need probabilities**: When you want not just a “yes or no” answer, but also “how likely is it?”  \n",
        "\n",
        "Some real-life examples are: \n",
        "\n",
        "- Predicting “should I bring an umbrella today?”: Using temperature, humidity, and wind speed, logistic regression might tell you “70% chance of rain”.  \n",
        "- Predicting “is this house worth buying?”: Using size, location, and price, it might say “80% worth buying”.\n",

We also saw the importance of features: `MedInc` (income) has a big positive weight (2.34), while `AveRooms` and `Population` have smaller or negative weights. But can we do better than 0.76? In this step, we’ll suggest some ideas for improving the model and let you try them out.\n",

        "1. **Add More Features**: We only used `MedInc`, `AveRooms`, and `Population`. What if we include other features like `HouseAge`, `Latitude`, or `Longitude`? Maybe they’ll help the model learn more patterns.\n",
        "2. **Tune the Model’s Settings**: logistic regression has a setting called `C` (it controls how strict the model is). The default is 1.0, but you could try smaller (like 0.1) or larger (like 10) values to see if it improves accuracy.\n",
        "3. **Adjust the Decision Threshold**: Right now, we predict “high price” if the probability is above 0.5 (default by logisticregression). What if we change it to 0.7 or 0.3? This might catch more high-priced areas (or fewer false positives).\n",
